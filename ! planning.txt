modules: Dashboard, Student Profile, Class Management, Attendance Tracking (!! NO RBAC)

✔ CRUD student profiles; fields:
✔ student’s name, email, IC number, date of birth, address, phone details, parent/guardian contact information

✔ CRUD classes; fields: class name, description
enable enrol

record attendance via table interface
when selecting class, system automatically uses today's date; diff date if necessary

error handling: duplicate enrollments, invalid inputs, data conflicts


Sir's clarification:
YOU ARE CLASS ADMIN, NOT STUDENT
attendance should be separate page (data can be [date]_[class])
date-class filter with today as default date 
class filter loads students who've enrolled
dropdown of enrolled students (not text field)
